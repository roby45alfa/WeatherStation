# Arduino-WeatherStation
A basic Weather Station created with an ESP8266 board (Arduino-Compatible Clone) and a DHT22 Sensor, which sends and saves the measure data in a remote database.

I used Arduino IDE, taking advantage of the ESP8266 support, for the .ino code and basically for the client-side of the project, and PHP with MySQL for the server-side.
